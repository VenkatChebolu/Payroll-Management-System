# Payroll-Management-System
A **Payroll Management System** is essential for any business, as it handles employee salaries, allowances, expenses, deductions, and taxes in line with legal requirements. Proper payroll management ensures compliance, prevents legal or financial risks, and supports accurate accounting for all employee payments. For SMEs, an efficient system enhances company reputation, streamlines operations, and manages legal obligations effectively. This project aims to help businesses handle payroll and employee expenses systematically, ensuring both management and regulatory compliance.
